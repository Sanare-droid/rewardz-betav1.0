# Onboarding & Photo Fixes Applied ✅

## Issue
After background agent made changes, they weren't appearing when running locally in Cursor.

## Root Cause
The background agent's changes were on a different branch (`origin/cursor/audit-project-for-issues-and-plan-implementation-f9b5`), and when conflict dialog appeared, "continue anyway and apply changes locally" was chosen, which **kept the local version and discarded the agent's changes**.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Global CSS Image Fixes** (CRITICAL - Was Missing)
**File**: `client/global.css`

Added global CSS rules to prevent image stretching/zooming:
```css
/* Prevent images from stretching/zooming - maintain aspect ratio */
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}

/* Fix for avatar images - maintain proper crop */
.avatar-image,
[class*="rounded-full"] img {
  object-fit: cover;
}

/* Fix for card images - ensure proper coverage */
.card-image,
.report-image,
.pet-image {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
  object-position: center;
}

/* Ensure images in aspect ratio containers fill properly */
[data-radix-aspect-ratio-wrapper] img {
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

### 2. **Onboarding Flow Fixes** (Already in working directory)
**Files**: `client/pages/Index.tsx`, `Login.tsx`, `Onboarding.tsx`, `PetOnboarding.tsx`

- ✅ Login now checks if user has pets and redirects to pet onboarding if none exist
- ✅ Home page uses `getDocs` instead of `onSnapshot` to prevent redirect loops
- ✅ User-specific onboarding tracking with `onboarding_${user.uid}` localStorage key
- ✅ Onboarding images use proper containers with `overflow-hidden` and `bg-muted`
- ✅ Images use `object-contain` for proper display without cropping

### 3. **Profile Logout Behavior**
**File**: `client/pages/Profile.tsx`

- ✅ Clears onboarding localStorage flags on logout
- ✅ Fixed avatar image with proper container and overflow handling

### 4. **Component Image Display Fixes**
**Files**: 
- `client/components/rewardz/AlertListItem.tsx`
- `client/pages/Community.tsx`
- `client/pages/ReportView.tsx`
- `client/pages/PetView.tsx`

- ✅ Wrapped all images in proper containers
- ✅ Added `flex-shrink-0` to prevent container shrinking
- ✅ Added `loading="lazy"` for performance
- ✅ Used `absolute inset-0` positioning for AspectRatio images
- ✅ Added proper alt text and bg-muted backgrounds

## How to Test

1. **Clear cache and localStorage**:
   ```bash
   # In browser DevTools (F12)
   Application → Storage → Clear site data
   ```

2. **Run the dev server**:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. **Test onboarding flow**:
   - Log out (should clear onboarding flags)
   - Log back in
   - If no pets → should redirect to `/pet-onboarding`
   - If has pets → should go to home

4. **Test image display**:
   - Check `/onboarding` - images should display properly without weird cropping
   - Check profile page - avatar should be circular
   - Check community page - post images and avatars should look correct
   - Check pet view - photos should maintain aspect ratio

## Files Changed
- `client/global.css` ⭐ CRITICAL
- `client/pages/Profile.tsx`
- `client/components/rewardz/AlertListItem.tsx`
- `client/pages/Community.tsx`
- `client/pages/ReportView.tsx`

## Status
✅ **ALL FIXES APPLIED** - The onboarding flow and photo display issues are now resolved.
