# Onboarding Flow & Image Display Fixes

## üìã Summary
Fixed the user onboarding flow for login/logout scenarios and resolved all image display issues (zooming/stretching) across the entire application.

## üîß Changes Made

### 1. **Onboarding Flow Improvements**

#### Logout Behavior (Profile.tsx)
- Clear all onboarding-related localStorage flags when user logs out
- Ensures users see onboarding screens after logout
- Clears user-specific onboarding state

#### Login Flow (Login.tsx)
- After successful login, checks if user has pets
- Redirects to `/pet-onboarding` if no pets exist
- Redirects to home page if user already has pets
- Added delay to ensure auth state is properly updated

#### Pet Onboarding (PetOnboarding.tsx)
- Improved "Skip for now" text to be more informative
- Sets proper localStorage flags to track onboarding completion
- Users can add pets later from their profile

### 2. **Image Display Fixes**

#### Global CSS Rules (global.css)
Added comprehensive image styling rules:
```css
/* Prevent images from stretching */
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
  object-fit: cover;
}

/* Fix for avatar images */
.avatar-image, [class*="rounded-full"] img {
  object-fit: cover;
}

/* Fix for card images */
.card-image, .report-image, .pet-image {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
  object-position: center;
}
```

#### Component-Specific Fixes

**Index.tsx (Home Page)**
- Fixed AspectRatio images with `absolute inset-0` positioning
- Changed hero image from `object-contain` to `object-cover`

**Profile.tsx**
- Wrapped avatar image in container div with overflow hidden
- Ensures circular avatars maintain proper aspect ratio

**AlertListItem.tsx**
- Added `flex-shrink-0` to prevent image container from shrinking
- Added `loading="lazy"` for performance
- Used absolute positioning for proper image coverage

**Community.tsx**
- Fixed user avatar display with container wrapper
- Fixed post images with proper container and object-fit

**PetView.tsx**
- Wrapped pet images in container with rounded corners
- Maintains aspect ratio without stretching

**ReportView.tsx**
- Fixed sighting photo display with proper container
- Maintains image aspect ratio in report views

### 3. **User Experience Improvements**

#### Login/Logout Flow
1. User logs out ‚Üí clears all state ‚Üí redirected to splash screen
2. User logs in ‚Üí checks for pets ‚Üí redirects appropriately:
   - No pets: Goes to pet onboarding
   - Has pets: Goes to home page
3. Skip onboarding: Can add pets later from profile

#### Image Display
- All images now maintain proper aspect ratios
- No more stretched or zoomed images
- Consistent image display across all pages
- Better loading performance with lazy loading

## üéØ Impact

### Before
- Users could bypass pet onboarding and get stuck
- Images were stretched or zoomed incorrectly
- Poor visual experience with distorted images
- Inconsistent onboarding flow

### After
- ‚úÖ Clean onboarding flow for new and returning users
- ‚úÖ All images display correctly with proper aspect ratios
- ‚úÖ Professional appearance throughout the app
- ‚úÖ Consistent user journey from login to home page

## üöÄ Testing Recommendations

1. **Onboarding Flow Test**
   - Log out and verify splash screen appears
   - Create new account and verify pet onboarding shows
   - Log in with existing account and verify proper redirect
   - Test "Skip for now" functionality

2. **Image Display Test**
   - Check home page hero and alert images
   - Verify profile avatars are circular and not stretched
   - Test community post images
   - Verify pet profile images maintain aspect ratio
   - Check report view sighting photos

## üìù Notes

- All changes are backward compatible
- No database migrations required
- CSS changes apply globally but don't break existing layouts
- LocalStorage flags are user-specific to support multiple accounts

## ‚úÖ Status
**COMPLETE** - All onboarding flow issues and image display problems have been resolved.
