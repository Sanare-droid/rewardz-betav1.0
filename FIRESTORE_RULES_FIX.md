# Firestore Permission Errors - Fixed

## üêõ Problem
You were experiencing `FirebaseError: [code=permission-denied]: Missing or insufficient permissions` errors in the browser console when accessing the Community page. This was happening because Firestore security rules were incomplete.

## ‚úÖ Solution
I've updated the `firebase.rules` file to include the missing security rules for the forums subcollection.

### Changes Made:

**Before:**
```javascript
// Forums
match /forums/{forumId} {
  allow read: if true;
  allow create: if isSignedIn() && request.resource.data.authorId == request.auth.uid;
  allow update: if isSignedIn() && resource.data.authorId == request.auth.uid;
  allow delete: if false;
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Forums
match /forums/{forumId} {
  allow read: if true;
  allow create: if isSignedIn() && request.resource.data.ownerId == request.auth.uid;
  allow update: if isSignedIn();
  allow delete: if false;

  match /members/{memberId} {
    allow read: if true;
    allow create: if isSignedIn();
    allow update: if isSignedIn();
    allow delete: if isSignedIn();
  }
}
```

### Key fixes:
1. ‚úÖ Added security rules for `forums/{forumId}/members/{memberId}` subcollection
2. ‚úÖ Fixed field name from `authorId` to `ownerId` to match your code
3. ‚úÖ Updated forum update rules to allow authenticated users to perform member operations

## üöÄ Deployment Required

To apply these changes, you need to deploy the updated rules to Firebase:

### Option 1: Using the deployment script
```bash
./deploy-firestore-rules.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual deployment
```bash
# Login to Firebase (if not already logged in)
firebase login

# Deploy the rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## ‚ú® Expected Result
After deploying these rules, the permission-denied errors should disappear and the Community page should work correctly for:
- ‚úÖ Viewing posts, stories, forums, and announcements
- ‚úÖ Creating and joining forums
- ‚úÖ Adding members to forums
- ‚úÖ Leaving forums
- ‚úÖ Reading comments on posts

## üìù Files Modified
- `firebase.rules` - Updated Firestore security rules
- `.firebaserc` - Created Firebase project configuration
- `deploy-firestore-rules.sh` - Created deployment helper script
