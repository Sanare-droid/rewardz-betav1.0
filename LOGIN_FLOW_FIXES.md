# Login Flow & Onboarding Image Fixes

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Login Flow - Pet Onboarding Redirect**

**Problem:** After login, users weren't being redirected to pet onboarding when they had no pets.

**Solution implemented in `/client/pages/Login.tsx`:**
- Added proper async/await flow to check for pets after login
- Wait for auth state to stabilize (500ms)
- Check user's pets collection in Firestore
- Redirect to `/pet-onboarding` if no pets found
- Added console logging for debugging
- Fixed loading state management with `finally` block

### 2. **Signup Flow - New User Onboarding**

**Problem:** New users weren't directed to pet onboarding after account creation.

**Solution implemented in `/client/pages/Signup.tsx`:**
- Changed redirect from home (`/`) to pet onboarding (`/pet-onboarding`)
- Ensures all new users see the pet registration prompt

### 3. **Onboarding Screen Images**

**Problem:** Images in onboarding screens were zoomed/cropped using `object-cover`.

**Solution implemented in `/client/pages/Onboarding.tsx`:**
- Changed from `object-cover` to `object-contain` for all 3 onboarding images
- Wrapped images in container divs with proper dimensions
- Added background color (`bg-muted`) to fill empty space
- Images now display fully without cropping

### 4. **Global CSS Improvements**

**Updated `/client/global.css`:**
```css
/* Default image behavior - maintain aspect ratio */
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}

/* For images that should fit without cropping */
img.object-contain {
  object-fit: contain;
}

/* Onboarding images should not be cropped */
.onboarding-image {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: contain;
}
```

## 🔄 User Flow After Fixes

### New User Journey:
1. **Splash** → **Onboarding Screens** → **Get Started** → **Sign Up**
2. After signup → **Pet Onboarding** 
3. Either "Register Pet" or "Skip" → **Home**

### Existing User (No Pets):
1. **Login** → Automatic check for pets
2. If no pets → **Pet Onboarding**
3. Either "Register Pet" or "Skip" → **Home**

### Existing User (Has Pets):
1. **Login** → Automatic check for pets
2. If has pets → **Home** directly

### Logout Flow:
1. **Logout** clears all onboarding flags
2. Redirects to **Splash**
3. User sees full onboarding flow again

## 🎨 Visual Improvements

- **Onboarding images** now display completely without cropping
- Images maintain their original aspect ratio
- Gray background (`bg-muted`) fills any empty space elegantly
- Consistent image display across all screens

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

## 📝 Debug Features Added

Console logging in login flow:

- "Pets found, redirecting to home"
- "Error checking pets: [error]"

These help diagnose any issues with the pet checking logic.

## ✨ Result

The app now provides a smooth, intuitive onboarding experience:
- New users are guided to register their pets
- Returning users without pets are prompted to add them
- Images display properly without distortion
- Clear user journey from signup/login to home page
